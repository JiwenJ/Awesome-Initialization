## Scope

μP is not just an initialization trick. It is a scaling-aware parameterization recipe covering initialization scales, learning-rate multipliers, readout and embedding treatment, and optimizer parameter groups. The practical goal of μTransfer is:

1. Convert the target architecture to μP.
2. Tune key hyperparameters on a small proxy model.
3. Transfer those hyperparameters to a much larger model without re-running the expensive sweep.

The broader scope includes neural-network initialization, scaling limits, SP / NTK / mean-field parameterizations, coordinate checks, and empirical reports on when hyperparameter transfer succeeds or fails.

## Topic Map

| Topic | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Width transfer | Original μTransfer framing and practical Transformer results. |
| Depth transfer | Depth-μP, effective-depth laws, and limits in modern residual blocks. |
| Embedding / readout scaling | Cases where embedding-layer learning rate or output scaling controls transfer quality. |
| Architecture-specific μP | GQA, diffusion Transformers, probabilistic Transformers, Fourier neural operators, sparse models, and LoRA. |
| Optimizer-specific transfer | Adaptive optimizers, Muon / hypersphere optimization, and optimizer-dependent scaling rules. |
| Schedule and data scaling | Token-budget, batch-size, warmup, and learning-rate schedule transfer. |
