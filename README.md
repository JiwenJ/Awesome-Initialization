## Why μP Matters

μP is not just an initialization trick. It is a scaling-aware parameterization recipe covering initialization scales, learning-rate multipliers, readout and embedding treatment, and optimizer parameter groups. The practical goal of μTransfer is:

1. Convert the target architecture to μP.
2. Tune key hyperparameters on a small proxy model.
3. Transfer those hyperparameters to a much larger model without re-running the expensive sweep.

The broader scope includes neural-network initialization, scaling limits, SP / NTK / mean-field parameterizations, coordinate checks, and empirical reports on when hyperparameter transfer succeeds or fails.

This is especially relevant for large Transformers, diffusion Transformers, sparse models, neural operators, and recent work on optimizer- or architecture-specific scaling laws.

## Recent μP / μTransfer Directions

- **Width transfer for LLMs** — original μTransfer framing and practical Transformer results.
- **Depth transfer** — Depth-μP, effective-depth laws, and limitations in modern multi-layer residual blocks.
- **Embedding and readout scaling** — recent evidence that embedding-layer learning rate can dominate apparent μP gains in AdamW language-model training.
- **Architecture-specific μP** — GQA-μP, diffusion Transformers, probabilistic Transformers, Fourier neural operators, MoE, LoRA, and sparse models.
- **Training-system variants** — u-μP for unit-scaled / low-precision training, SμPar for sparse training, HyperP for hypersphere optimization with Muon, and matrix-preconditioned optimizer scaling.
- **Schedule and data scaling** — combining μP with token-, batch-size-, weight-decay-, and learning-rate-schedule transfer.

| Topic | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Width transfer | Original μTransfer framing and practical Transformer results. |
| Depth transfer | Depth-μP, effective-depth laws, and limits in modern residual blocks. |
| Embedding / readout scaling | Cases where embedding-layer learning rate or output scaling controls transfer quality. |
| Architecture-specific μP | GQA, diffusion Transformers, probabilistic Transformers, Fourier neural operators, sparse models, and LoRA. |
| Optimizer-specific transfer | Adaptive optimizers, Muon / hypersphere optimization, and optimizer-dependent scaling rules. |
| Schedule and data scaling | Token-budget, batch-size, warmup, and learning-rate schedule transfer. |
